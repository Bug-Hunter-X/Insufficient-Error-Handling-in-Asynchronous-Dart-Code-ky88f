# Insufficient Error Handling in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart asynchronous programming: insufficient error handling. The provided code fetches data from an API. However, error handling is insufficient for a user-friendly experience.

## The Problem
The `fetchData` function uses a `try-catch` block, which is good practice. But, the `catch` block only prints the exception to the console using `print('Error: $e');`. This is not user-friendly, as it shows the entire exception details (stack trace, type, etc.) to the end user which can be very confusing. Additionally, `rethrow` is used which passes the error up to higher levels of the application without additional context.

## The Solution
The solution improves error handling by providing more specific and user-friendly error messages instead of raw exception details. It handles different error scenarios with more informative messages.
